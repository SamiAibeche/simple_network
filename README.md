We created a simple network project for only three people working on it.

Robert Tappan Morris, the CEO, insists on the fact that Hackers Poulette is bound to grow, that the ambitions of the startup are great. 

So he wants an installation that is __easily scalable__ . All three hosts must also be connected to the internet.
